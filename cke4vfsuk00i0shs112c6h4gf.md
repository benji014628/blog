## How to Get Your Project off the Ground

# How to Get Your Project off the Ground


_You can always dry yourself off after getting your feet wet._

Whether you are a novice or a proficient in programming who maybe has several project ideas and believe they have a real-world use case and many people will see your website or download your app, then this is the place for you.

# First — Choosing the Right Idea

The best way to find what idea will have the most success is the one most relatable to you. Typically that would fall into a particular interest or hobby you enjoy. For example, I have played the violin for nearly six years and want to develop a music theory website, but I don’t know if others would use it or the design the product will have. These are critical questions to factor in before opening an IDE and start to code blindly.
