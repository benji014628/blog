## My Favorite VS Code Extensions

As VS Code has become one of the highly used IDE by so many developers, here are a few helpful extensions I use. If there are any you use that aren't on this list, comment them down below.

# Extensions

-[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is first on the list for obvious reasons, a live local server to see your code on a browser.
-  [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode) not one I see talked about but all the bit useful, packed with tiny use case features that some other extensions copy. 
-  [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) is an excellent tool to debug your Javascript with live comments, logging, values, and much more!
-  [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) is a small yet incredible lifesaver if and when your folders overflood with loads of folders and files in each other.
-  [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) is for quickly renaming tags 2x faster.
-  [CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek) is pretty handy to view CSS in HTML and rewrite without endlessly searching for that one line of code.
-  [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) for commenting code in a more human-friendly way and helps distinguish them easily.
-  [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is a remarkable extension to customize your code format.
-  [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory) and  [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) are fantastic for keeping updated on your file changes.
