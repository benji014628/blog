## Recap of #2Articles1Week

Participating in this challenge was a fantastic way to continue growing my writing skills and share subjects I am passionate about for everybody to read. It helped open my mind to discover new ideas and expand my knowledge base. I am grateful for the incredible ever-growing community built on Hashnode, and without it, there is so much I wouldn't have known. Going forward here is my list of upcoming articles I will publish soon:


- set-up examples of svelte, react, and vue (w/ tailwindcss)
- code snippets and tutorials
- side preview of my projects
