## 3 Great Chrome Extensions for Developers

## 1. CSS Peeper

Don't want to bother sniffing around in DevTools? Well, that's why [this tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk?hl=en) exists and allows you to inspect elements to get specifications, find all the colors in a friendly visual way, and export nested assets.

## 2. Web Vitals

Web vitals is [web.dev/vitals](https://web.dev.com/vitals) but provides instant feedback on performance metrics for every page you visit.

## 3. Rainbow Color Picker

Now for all the colors, CSS Peeper can't find such as on images, etc. This [tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rainbow-color-picker/mlcjgkkpemdfclhfehjpgaaagkfpnnki) can find them.
