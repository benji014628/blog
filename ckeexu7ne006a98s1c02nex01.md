## Git & GitHub Intro

Two days ago was my first time using [Git](https://git-scm.com) and  [GitHub](https://github.com), and I've been a frontend developer for about four years! Pretty crazy, right? Well, that's because I haven't created any real projects and never considered using them until I wrote my [previous story](https://jacobsheep.hashnode.dev/build-a-journal-app-w-vanilla-js-cked9ls8o01bfsgs1dga7eabc). So I've decided to write why you should use these two incredible tools.

# What is Git?

Git is known as a distributed version control system or VCS for short. It is a system that tracks and records revisions to our project files over time, enables us to go back to a specific version of those files at any time, and create copies of our project that can merge into the main version. Alongside it is excellent to **collaborate efficiently** for team projects. Also, you can use Git separately from GitHub. 

# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a hosting platform to upload your local Git repositories where you can interact with yours and other public repositories published by other developers. Any developer can clone remote repositories to their computer, work on a local version of the project, and whenever they're ready, they can make a pull request of those changes. If the owner accepts them, they'll be pushed to the remote repository hosted on GitHub. GitHub is also a popular way for developers to publish their project portfolio online to showcase skills and experience to potential employers or clients.

A cool application that combines both these tools is [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) making it easier and faster to see your file changes, add them, commit on them, and push them all in one place.
